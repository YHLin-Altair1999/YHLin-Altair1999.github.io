									演講中作為鋪陳的前半部分，基本上是 Veritasium 過去一系列對認知科學的影片的大串連，如果你已經熟悉相關的內容，那基本上可以直接從中間開始看。簡單的說，其核心論點是有效的學習發生在學生有意識的刻意練習、並一步步將這些經驗轉化為直覺的過程中。<br>
									<br>
									而 LLM 的出現會讓學生傾向於跳過這個緩慢而辛苦的過程，直接得到想要的現實成果，比如直接生成作業或報告的答案等等。但缺少這些辛苦的練習，學生的學習效果就會大打折扣。演講中舉的例子是，我們這一代人因為很早就接觸鍵盤，過著很少親筆寫字的生活，所以手寫比起老一輩的人自然差距明顯。下一代的學生如果在成長過程中大量使用 GenAI，這對他們的大腦組織文句、安排文章結構、進行邏輯推理的能力，又會有怎樣的影響呢？<br>
									<br>
									因此 Veritasium 的主張基本上是，GenAI 有其正面意義，比如能夠為每一個學生提供家教般的即時回饋。但如果學生用 GenAI 跳過了應該讓其大腦進行的練習，那這對學習效果會有很大的負面影響。因此 GenAI 在教學現場應該被管控，而具體怎麼設計管控的方法就需要對人怎麼學習有正確的認識。<br>
									<br>
									演講還觸及了其他幾個值得一提的點。<br>
									<br>
									過去 Veritasium 有一部影片討論的是歷史上「改變教育的革命性發明」。比如動畫、收音機、MOOCs、網際網路等等，在過去一個世紀中都曾經被人們當作能夠革新教育的發明或概念，但這個「革命」卻從未發生。由此我們可以問兩個問題：<br>
									<br>
									一、為什麼人們沒有在學習？<br>
									二、為什麼這些教育革命始終沒有發生？<br>
									<br>
									Veritasium 的觀點是，人們沒有在學習不是因為獲取知識的管道匱乏：無論是半世紀前還是現在，我們能在合理的成本下取得的知識，早已超出多數人一生所需。人們缺乏知識，甚至連「水是 H2O」這種基本的科學常識都不知道，根本上是因為沒有學習的動機。<br>
									<br>
									但 Derek 認為，我們應該對這點抱有一定程度的寬容。因為現實是，即便我們認為「二氧化碳如何造成全球暖化」等知識對人類的未來至關重要，社會上大部分人的生活並不需要用到這些。人們在乎的是如何在 IG 上分享自己的精采生活、如何經營自己的朋友圈圈等等。<br>
									<br>
									而我認為這個態度是很重要的。對絕大多數人來說，比起人生前十幾年在學校被填鴨硬塞的那些知識，人們更傾向於相信自己在更多年的生活經驗中逐漸累積起來的價值觀，因為那些才是經過自身重複驗證後判定有效的東西。此時，理直氣壯地指責乃至於嘲笑對方的無知，往往只會激化對立而不會改變對方的想法。這點在科學傳播是如此，在科學以外其他價值的推廣上亦然。<br>
									<br>
									至於為什麼革命沒有發生，Veritasium 之前的影片裏面就已經說過，他認為這是因為重點不是這些外界的工具，而是學生腦中發生的事（也就是前文敘述的關於刻意練習的部分）。在此之上，Derek 說：某些程度上，我有點覺得教育的革命之所以沒有到來，也許是因為現在的教學方式，即「一群有學習熱忱的學生、老師，在同一個空間中對話」，就已經是最好的模式。<br>
									<br>
									我對此部分同意。不同意的點在於我覺得 Derek 有點為了演講的脈絡刻意把這話說的絕了一點，身為研究者，我們幾乎在所有的情況下都不該篤定認為自己已經找到完美的答案，未來永遠有更多的可能。<br>
									<br>
									但我很同意人們應當關注教育現場的社會性。如前述，百年來知識的傳遞管道早已不太是問題，問題是學生的學習動機。正如健身的方法很多，但肥胖仍然是普遍的問題。老師的重要性不只在擔任知識傳遞的樞紐，更是要引導建立一個能讓學生互相砥礪前行的環境。

									<p>
										A Veritasium lecture at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. As the title suggests, it discusses the impact of AI on education.
									</p>
									<p>
										The first half of the lecture, which serves as groundwork, is essentially a compilation of Veritasium's past series of videos on cognitive science. If you're already familiar with the related content, you can basically start watching from the middle. In simple terms, the core argument is that effective learning occurs when students consciously engage in deliberate practice and gradually transform these experiences into intuition.
									</p>
									<p>
										The emergence of LLMs tends to make students inclined to skip this slow and arduous process, directly obtaining the desired practical results, such as generating answers for assignments or reports. However, without these challenging exercises, the learning effectiveness for students is significantly reduced. The example given in the lecture is that our generation, having been exposed to keyboards early on and living a life with minimal handwriting, naturally has poorer handwriting compared to older generations. What impact will the extensive use of GenAI during their formative years have on the next generation of students' ability to organize sentences, structure articles, and perform logical reasoning?
									</p>
									<p>
										Therefore, Veritasium's basic assertion is that GenAI has its positive aspects, such as providing immediate feedback like a tutor for every student. However, if students use GenAI to bypass the exercises their brains should be performing, it will have a substantial negative impact on learning effectiveness. Consequently, GenAI should be regulated in educational settings, and designing specific control methods requires a correct understanding of how people learn.
									</p>
									<p>
										The lecture also touched on several other noteworthy points.
									</p>
									<p>
										In a previous Veritasium video, he discussed the "revolutionary inventions that would change education" throughout history. Innovations like animation, radio, MOOCs, the internet, etc., have all been regarded as inventions or concepts that could revolutionize education over the past century, but this "revolution" has never materialized. From this, we can ask two questions:
									</p>
									<p>
										1. Why aren't people learning?<br>
										2. Why have these educational revolutions never occurred?
									</p>
									<p>
										Veritasium's view is that people aren't learning not because of a scarcity of knowledge acquisition channels: whether half a century ago or now, the knowledge we can obtain at a reasonable cost has long exceeded what most people need in a lifetime. The fundamental reason people lack knowledge, even to the extent of not knowing basic scientific facts like "water is H2O," is because they lack the motivation to learn.
									</p>
									<p>
										However, Derek believes we should have a certain degree of tolerance for this. The reality is that even though we may consider knowledge like "how carbon dioxide causes global warming" crucial for the future of humanity, most people in society don't need to use this in their daily lives. People care more about how to share their exciting lives on Instagram or how to manage their social circles.
									</p>
									<p>
										I think this attitude is important. For the vast majority of people, compared to the knowledge force-fed to them during their first decade or so of schooling, people tend to believe more in the values they gradually accumulate through more years of life experience, because those are the things that have been repeatedly verified and deemed effective by themselves. In such cases, self-righteously criticizing or even mocking the other person's ignorance often only intensifies opposition rather than changing their perspective. This holds true in scientific communication and equally applies to the promotion of other values beyond science.
									</p>
									<p>
										As for why the revolution hasn't happened, Veritasium has already mentioned in his previous videos that he believes it's because the focus isn't on these external tools but on what happens in the student's brain (that is, the deliberate practice part mentioned earlier). Building on this, Derek says: To some extent, I somewhat feel that the reason the educational revolution hasn't arrived may be because the current teaching method, namely "a group of enthusiastic students and teachers engaging in dialogue in the same space," is already the best model.
									</p>
									<p>
										I partially agree with this. Where I disagree is that I think Derek has somewhat deliberately made this statement absolute for the sake of the lecture's flow. As researchers, we should almost never firmly believe that we have found the perfect answer in any situation; the future always holds more possibilities.
									</p>
									<p>
										But I strongly agree that people should pay attention to the social aspects of the educational environment. As mentioned earlier, the channels for knowledge transmission have not been a problem for a century; the issue is students' motivation to learn. Just as there are many methods for fitness, yet obesity remains a widespread problem. The importance of teachers lies not only in serving as hubs for knowledge transmission but also in guiding and establishing an environment where students can mutually encourage each other to progress.
