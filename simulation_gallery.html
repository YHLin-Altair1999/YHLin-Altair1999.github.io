										<h2>Restricted three-body problem</h2>
                                        <p>I developed this code in the co-rotating frame of the restricted three-body with circular orbit to test my understanding of orbital dynamics and non-inertial frame. See my <a href="https://github.com/CFP106020008/Lagrange_Points">Github</a> for more details about the code.</p>
                                        <h3>Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO)</h3>
										<p>DRO is a family of stable orbits around a secondary body in a three body system. Recently famous for being used by Orion spacecraft in the Artemis I mission.</p>

                                        </video>
                                        <p>In this video, I placed several test particles around the moon with opposite velcoity vector (retrograde->cyan;prograde->orange) to show that orbits are stable only if the particles are moving in retrograde orbits. I adpoted the inital condition from <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/aerospace3040037">Turner, G. Results of Long-Duration Simulation of Distant Retrograde Orbits. Aerospace 2016, 3, 37.</a></p>
                                        <h3>Lagrange Points</h3>
                                        <p>You can't ignore Lagrange points when talking about restricted three-body problem! Here I used 2 videos to show the importance of mass ratio on the stability of Lagrange points.</p>

										<h2>Ballistic Missile Simulation</h2>
                                        <p>In this work, I aim to simulate the trajectory of ballistic missles (or anything else that shares similar physics such as sub-orbital spaceflight and re-entry vehicles) cause I found so many people in Taiwan have no idea how they work. This simulation includes the effects of rocket equation, orbital mechanics and atmospheric drag with a somewhat realistic density profile. Check my <a href="https://github.com/CFP106020008/Ballistic_Missile_Simulation">Github</a> for more details!</p>

                                        <p>Beside my main research topic, I also use <a href="https://flash.rochester.edu/site/index.shtml">FLASH</a> to simulate whatever I found interesting.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/CFP106020008/Atmospheric_Corona">Atmospheric Corona</a></h2>
                                        <p>Corona forms when sun/moon light is diffracted by the small water droplet in the sky. The resulting PSF should be an Airy disk. In the code, we first convolve the source function (a disk with diameter of 0.5 degree) with Airy kernal. Then we integrate the resulting monochromatic image over wavelength and eventually create RGB image. We do not really consider the transmission curve of any DSLR and the responce function of the human eyes. Nonetheless, current results looks surprisingly good.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/CFP106020008/Light-Sail-Simulation">Light Sail Simulation</a></h2>
                                        <p>Light sail is one of the most promising technology that could accelerate spacecraft to a significant portion of the light speed. In this work, I simulate the trajectory of a solar sail (accelerated by solar radiation pressure).</p>
